\section{Overall Status of LL}
\par
While our team is not as far as we would have liked to have been by this point we do have a working version of Cellular Automata using the Game of Life rule set. At this point with game of life nearly functioning properly (there is one small bug that needs finding/fixing) we now have a framework which will allow us to run some rule sets which have slightly more complicated rules than Game of Life. We would like to have at the very least one more rule set implemented but are hoping for more because the more rule sets we have the more we can compare data between them and run different types of tests using them. We will be setting our sights next on the next rule set as well as parallelizing what we already have. Once those two things are finished we will begin the testing phase where we analyze our results and find ways to optimize our existing code base. If that all runs according to plan then we should have time for one more rule set.
